The goal of this project is to create a parser application that can
parse a variety of Context Free Grammars (CFGs)

I plan to start with a Top-Down Parser (Recursive Descent) with a stack (though I will have to check for Left-Recursion).

Also possible I may implement a Bottom-Up Parser to avoid having to check for left-recursion in the case of the Top-Down Parser.
